# Nebula CTFd Theme

This is a CTFd theme I bodged together for CompClub CTF 2021. Feel free to use it if you like it, but a lot of things are pretty hacky - I just copied the default core theme and modified things here and there - the CTFd frontend isn't too well documented.

## Known issues
- Graph text (for scoreboard) has poor contrast with background.
