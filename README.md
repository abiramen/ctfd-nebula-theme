# Nebula CTFd Theme

This is a CTFd theme I bodged together for CompClub CTF 2021. Feel free to use it if you like it, but a lot of things are pretty hacky - I just copied the default core theme and modified things here and there - the CTFd frontend isn't too well documented. As a result, there's probably a lot of poor practices (and reused code). I'll probably make a proper theme in the future.

## Usage
Clone the repo into `CTFd-path/CTFd/themes`. Access the CTFd Admin Panel and select the new theme.
